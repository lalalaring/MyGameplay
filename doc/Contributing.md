The [gameplay3d.io](http://www.gameplay3d.io) project would like to build a strong 3D indie community working together supporting cross-platform gaming.

## Developers Welcome! 
If you are interested in contributing to the project, send me an email. 
You can send the email to me (Sean Taylor/seanpaultaylor) at uber.setaylor@gmail.com. 
I will find some issues/features that we have which you are interested in to work on in one of the 'next' milestones.
